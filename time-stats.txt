Here is the timing for the original slicer in pyslicer.py:
#In
%%timeit
res, likes = slicer(log_posterior, 3, [24.0, 0.5, 2.0], [xdata, ydata], N=5000);
#Out
1.86 s ± 10.8 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)

The row version was slightly slower:
2.02 s ± 16.8 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)

So I dumped that git branch and pushed the original.
